What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us,
like backup files created by our editor
or intermediate files created during data analysis?
Let's create a few dummy files:

~~~
$ mkdir receipts
$ touch a.png b.png c.png receipts/a.jpg receipts/b.jpg
~~~
{: .language-bash}

and see what Git says:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	a.png
	b.png
	c.png
	receipts/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~
{: .output}

Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space.
What's worse,
having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter,
so let's tell Git to ignore them.

We do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`:

~~~
$ nano .gitignore
$ cat .gitignore
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
*.png
receipts/
~~~
{: .output}

These patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in `.png`
and everything in the `receipts` directory.
(If any of these files were already being tracked,
Git would continue to track them.)

Once we have created this file,
the output of `git status` is much cleaner:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
~~~
{: .output}

The only thing Git notices now is the newly-created `.gitignore` file.
You might think we wouldn't want to track it,
but everyone we're sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore
the same things that we're ignoring.
Let's add and commit `.gitignore`:

~~~
$ git add .gitignore
$ git commit -m "Ignore png files and the receipts folder."
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch main
nothing to commit, working directory clean
~~~
{: .output}

As a bonus, using `.gitignore` helps us avoid accidentally adding to the repository files that we don't want to track:

~~~
$ git add a.png
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
a.png
Use -f if you really want to add them.
~~~
{: .output}

If we really want to override our ignore settings,
we can use `git add -f` to force Git to add something. For example,
`git add -f a.dat`.
We can also always see the status of ignored files if we want:

~~~
$ git status --ignored
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch main
Ignored files:
 (use "git add -f <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        a.png
        b.png
        c.png
        receipts/

nothing to commit, working directory clean
~~~
{: .output}

> Hint: Find out what `!` (the exclamation point operator) does
>
> > ## Solution

> ## Ignoring Nested Files: Variation

> Given a directory structure that looks similar to the earlier Nested Files

>
> ~~~
> receipts/data
> receipts/images
> receipts/plots
> receipts/analysis
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> How would you ignore all of the contents in the receipts folder, but not `receipts/data`?

> ## Ignoring all data Files in a Directory
>
> Assuming you have an empty .gitignore file, and given a directory structure that looks like:
>
> ~~~
> receipts/data/market_position/gps/a.dat
> receipts/data/market_position/gps/b.dat
> receipts/data/market_position/gps/c.dat
> receipts/data/market_position/gps/info.txt
> receipts/plots
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> What's the shortest `.gitignore` rule you could write to ignore all `.dat`
> files in `result/data/market_position/gps`? Do not ignore the `info.txt`.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > Appending `receipts/data/market_position/gps/*.dat` will match every file in `receipts/data/market_position/gps`
> > that ends with `.dat`.
> > The file `receipts/data/market_position/gps/info.txt` will not be ignored.

> ## The Order of Rules
>
> Given a `.gitignore` file with the following contents:
>
> ~~~
> *.dat
> !*.dat
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> What will be the result?
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > The `!` modifier will negate an entry from a previously defined ignore pattern.
> > Because the `!*.dat` entry negates all of the previous `.dat` files in the `.gitignore`,
> > none of them will be ignored, and all `.dat` files will be tracked.

> ## Log Files
>
> You wrote a script that creates many intermediate log-files of the form `log_01`, `log_02`, `log_03`, etc.
> You want to keep them but you do not want to track them through `git`.
>
> 1. Write **one** `.gitignore` entry that excludes files of the form `log_01`, `log_02`, etc.
>
> 2. Test your "ignore pattern" by creating some dummy files of the form `log_01`, etc.
>
> 3. You find that the file `log_01` is very important after all, add it to the tracked files without changing the `.gitignore` again.
>
> 4. Discuss with your neighbor what other types of files could reside in your directory that you do not want to track and thus would exclude via `.gitignore`.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > 1. append either `log_*`  or  `log*`  as a new entry in your .gitignore
> > 3. track `log_01` using   `git add -f log_01`
